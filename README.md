angular-cog
===========
declarative ajax requests for angularjs 

### Cog?
A subordinate member of an organization who performs necessary but usually minor or routine functions.

### Groundwork first
angular-cog exposes few directives that act as helpers for ajax requests. For every request 4 attributes are most important

1. Url
2. Data to be sent
3. Headers
3. Whether reponse is success or error

angular-cog allows you to configure these from html directive and remove the clutter from javascript.

### Installation
Installation is very straight forward. Grab the latest zip from github. Copy angular-cog.min.js in your root, and refer it in your page.
```html
<script type='text/javascript' href='path/to/js/angular-cog.min.js'></script>
```
Then,add it as dependency in your module
```javascript
angular.module('yourApp', ['angularCog']);
```
### Directive
```html
<!-- verb in cog-verb could be - get, post, put or delete -->
<div cog-verb="{url}" 
		cog-model="{ng-model}" 
		cog-success="{angular.expression}" 
		cog-error="{angular.expression}"
		cog-trigger="{angular.expression}"
		cog-no-spinner="{true|false}" 
		cog-absolute-url="{true|false}" 
		cog-config="{object}">
</div>
```

Attribute | Meaning | Example
--- | --- | ---
```cog-*verb*``` | url to call, [get,post,put,delete] decides the http verb | ```cog-get="/users"```, ```cog-post="/users"```
```cog-model``` | data that will be passed with post and put request  | ```cog-model="user"```
```cog-success``` | expression to evaluate if response is 200 | ```cog-success="users = $data"```, ```cog-success="setUsers($data)```
```cog-error``` | expression to evaluate if response is not 200 | ```cog-error="error($headers)"```
```cog-trigger``` | by default, request will be sent as soon as directive is compiled, in case you would like to delay the request you could use cog-trigger. angular-cog will watch the expression and fire the request as soon as it becomes true. **applicable to cog-get only** | ```cog-trigger="user != null"```
```cog-no-spinner``` | if you don't want to display spinner for this particular request, refer [spinner](#spinner) for more information | ```cog-no-spinner="true"```
```cog-absolute-url``` | by default CogConfig.rootUrl will be prepended to every url, if you don't want to then use this attribute  | ```cog-absolute-url="true"```
```cog-config``` | header object to pass to angular $http  | 

**Note:** ```cog-post``` and ```cog-put``` are only allowed on ```<form>``` elements. Refer [sample](#sample-usages) usages for more information.

**Special attributes available from directive**
```javascript
$data //angularjs data object
$status //angularjs status object
$headers //angularjs headers object
$config //angularjs config object
```
for more information please visit [$http](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http) documentation.

### Configuration
angular-cog allows you to configure following, comment in front of attribute states default value
```javascript
angular.module('example').config(function(CogConfigProvider) {
  	//prepended to every request url
	CogConfigProvider.rootUrl = {url}; //""
	//log function to call after every request, could be used for tracing
	CogConfigProvider.log = {function}; //angular.noop;
	//this will be called if request returns with error
	CogConfigProvider.error = {function}; //angular.noop;
	//this will be called if request returns with success
	CogConfigProvider.success = {function}; //angular.noop;
	//enables, disables spinner. refer spinner section for more
	CogConfigProvider.enableSpinner = {true|false}; //true
});
```

### Sample usages
**cog-get**
```html
<!-- By default, get requests are made as soon as directive is linked
if you would like to manually trigger the request use cog-trigger -->

<!-- this will trigger a GET /users request and 
if successful, fill returned data in $scope.users -->
<div cog-get="/users" cog-success="users = $data"></div>

<!-- this will trigger a GET /users request and 
if failed, call  $scope.checkError function with status code as argument -->
<div cog-get="/users" cog-error="checkError($status)"></div>
```
**cog-post**
```html
<!-- POST /users will be sent once form is submitted, 
model defined in cog-model will be sent as payload -->
<!-- on success angular-cog will push newly returned user to $scope.users -->
<!-- notice the usage of $data, this is inserted by angular-cog -->
<form cog-post="/users" cog-model="newUser" cog-success="users.push($data)">
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.name" required/>
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.email" required/>
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.password" required/>
  <button type="submit" value="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
**cog-put**
```html
<!-- PUT /users will be sent once form is submitted, 
model defined in cog-model will be sent as data -->
<!-- on success angular-cog will call $scope.enjoySuccess() function -->
<form cog-put="/users" cog-model="newUser" cog-success="enjoySuccess()">
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.name" required/>
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.email" required/>
  <input type="text" ng-model="newUser.password" required/>
  <button type="submit" value="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
**Note:** for ```cog-put``` and ```cog-post```, ```cog-model``` is necessary. else the request will be sent with blank payload. Also, ```cog-put``` and ```cog-post``` can be only used with ```<form>``` elements, this restriction is imposed so we can leverage validations provided by angularjs.

**cog-delete**
```html
<!-- this will trigger a DELETE /users/1 request on click event of this div and 
if successful, call  $scope.removeUser function with returned data as argument -->
<div cog-delete="/users/1" cog-success="removeUser($data)"></div>
```

### Spinner
It could be a lot of pain to track all ajax requests from view and display loaders accordingly. angular-cog provides an easy fix for this problem. Each request is pushed to a stack and poped once returned, and till the stack has atleast one element we display the spinner.

To get spinner working in your project follow these steps:

1. Set ```CogConfigProvider.enableSpinner``` to ```true```
2. There is no step two.


By default all requests made by angular-cog will be tracked, to get spinner for your own ajax requests follow this:

1. Add ```SpinnerService``` as an argument to your controller
2. Call ```SpinnerService.spin()``` before making the request
3. Call ```SpinnerService.stop()``` once the response is received (either success or error!)
4. Drink tea, tea is good.
